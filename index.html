            Hello, I am a Software Engineering major with an emphasis on Software Design. I like to play video games
            with my wife and
            sing with her. I also like spending time playing with my kids and being out in nature. I am married to my
            wonderful wife
            Rosie and have three children now. We just had our newborn son, Mattias, born about 3 weeks ago now. My
            oldest Lily is
            five years old and my middle child, Peter is 3 years old. It has been a crazy three weeks.
            <br>
            The thing I love the most about BYU Idaho is that I have had the opportunity to learn from people and be in
            a place
            where the Spirit of the Lord freely resides. It has been such a blessing and it continues to be such a
            blessing to myself
            and my family.
            <br>
            In today’s day and age, you kind of must have a working knowledge of wed development if you want to be an
            any kind of
            Software developer and/or Engineer. Even if you are going into anything in the tech industry you should have
            a good
            knowledge of it because of how useful the knowledge is and will be if there is a need for web sites and
            services out
            there. I hope that I will learn to become a better developer from taking this in general and learn the
            fundamentals
            of Web Design to help others in the future.

            I was born into the covenant, so I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ all my life. My favorite
            quote
            is a quote from a talk that I have often reread and found renewed strength throughout my life. It is by
            Elder Holland, “An High Priest of Good Things to Come”,
        <div class="textbox">
            “Some blessings come soon, some come late,<br>
            and some don’t come until heaven;<br> but for
            those who embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ,<br>
            they come.”
