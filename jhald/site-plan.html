    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of my portfolio website is to show my works and passions in a visually pleasing
      way to employers to help introduce my works and help them get a feel for who I am personally more so then
      they could from just a resume could ever say alone.
    </p> <!-- change this -->


    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The target audience is directly employers that are wanting to see if I might be a good fit for their company.
      They
      want to know more about a person than a resume could ever represent and therefore they want to pick developers
      that
      they think would be qualified and would be a good fit into the company to interview. They want to waste as little
      time
      and resources on looking for potential developers as possible.

      Content
    </h2>
    <h3>Home page</h3>
    <p>
      The site will offer a consolidated menu to navigate to my projects and to learn more about me. They will be able
      to navigate to easily to my
      works through links to my GitHub projects. The images will be links. There will also be detailed descriptions of
      my projects for each of them and how they work. There will also be a page of information on my personal life the

    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      Expectations and About Me:
      They may wonder more about who I am and what I have done. This site will give a much better picture of who I am
      and what I have done. It will possibly answer some questions that employers might have before reaching out for an
      interview. It would help them see me through more than just a resume. It will have information about my life, my
      likes, values, family, aspirations, and my work ethic. <br>
      â€¢ The Why <br>
      They will want to come to my website because it will be a place where employers can learn more about me. They will
      also be able to see some of my passion projects and works. Instead of employers just having a resume and a GitHub
      link, I can consolidate the work they would have to do to learn more about me. They want to waste as little time
      as possible on looking for candidates and worrying about if they would be a good fit for the company. My website
      will make it very easy to present important information to the writer and provide easy access to my projects with
      descriptions of the project.

    <h3>Project and Works</h3>

      about myself and seeing my portfolio. It will make it much simpler for an employer to get a good idea of who I am
      and my works. This website will reduce the amount of work an employer would need to do to navigate through
      information about myself. They will be presented will the desired information and have access to all the projects
      that I have available. The images will be links to my projects and when hovered over there will be a short
